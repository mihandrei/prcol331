# Rosu #

It is an application  that organizes common teaching activities.

A lot of thought has been given to the user interface.

It is simple almost minimalistic but highly functional and intuitive.

Started as a 1 semester university project.

The main development branch is /rosu.

It is under development and highly unstable.
Unfortunately documentation is scarce and Romanian text appears often.
